They do not require ethics committee approval, mentorship, statistical consultation or institutional support.

                        You have likely come across an evidence pyramid during your healthcare training. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses occupy its highest level, representing the strongest evidence. Mastering these methods ensures that you can conduct research with significant impact. Rather than focusing on case reports or lower-tier studies, develop the expertise to conduct systematic reviews and meta-analyses, publish in leading journals, and present at major international conferences.

His work has accumulated more than 2,500 citations and is referenced in guidelines by the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and European Society of Cardiology.

                    Each of the 10 modules combines both theoretical and practical elements. First, you will have a recorded lesson focused on theory and core concepts, with a unique instructional approach. Next, you will have the chance to apply these concepts through a hands-on exercise grounded in current literature, developing the skills necessary to undertake such steps independently.

                    Lastly, a live practical session is held, during which the exercise is reviewed collaboratively with Dr. Cardoso and other teachers in the course. These interactive classes, which are called Curricular Practical Training (CPTs), encourage engagement from all participants through questions and discussions. Sessions are scheduled weekly on Sundays (for the English-speaking cohorts). If you are unable to attend the live sessions, recordings are made available for your review. Access to the program is for a full year from the onset of classes.
